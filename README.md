## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting techniques are used to organize elements in a specific sequenceâ€”most commonly in ascending or descending order. Each method varies in speed, space usage, and stability.

| Sorting Algorithm        | Best Case   | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity | Stable? |
|-------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **Selection Sort**      | O(nÂ²)       | O(nÂ²)        | O(nÂ²)      | O(1)             | No      |
| **Bubble Sort**         | O(n)        | O(nÂ²)        | O(nÂ²)      | O(1)             | Yes     |
| **Insertion Sort**      | O(n)        | O(nÂ²)        | O(nÂ²)      | O(1)             | Yes     |
| **Merge Sort**          | O(n log n)  | O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)             | Yes     |
| **Quick Sort**          | O(n log n)  | O(n log n)   | O(nÂ²)      | O(log n)         | No      |
| **Iterative Quick Sort**| O(n log n)  | O(n log n)   | O(nÂ²)      | O(log n)         | No      |

- ### Selection Sort  
: Selects the smallest element and places it at the beginning of the array, repeating the process for the remaining elements.

- ### Bubble Sort (`bubblesort.cpp`)  
: Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

- ### Insertion Sort (`insertionsort.cpp`)  
: Takes one element at a time and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted portion.

- ### Merge Sort  
: Applies a divide-and-conquer method by splitting the array into halves, sorting, and merging them.

- ### Quick Sort  
: Chooses a pivot, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

- **Iterative Quick Sort** (`iterativequicksort.cpp`)  
: An iterative version of quick sort using an explicit stack instead of recursion.
